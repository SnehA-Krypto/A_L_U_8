This project implements an 8-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) in Verilog, capable of performing both arithmetic and logical operations based on a 4-bit control signal (sel). The ALU supports operations such as addition, subtraction, increment, and decrement under arithmetic mode, as well as AND, OR, XOR, and NOT under logical mode. The module has simple I/O ports: two 8-bit inputs (opA and opB), a 4-bit operation selector (sel), an enable signal, an 8-bit result output, and a carry/borrow flag output. The sel input determines the operation, where the MSB (sel[3]) indicates whether the ALU works in arithmetic mode (1) or logic mode (0), while the lower three bits (sel[2:0]) specify the exact operation. For example, in arithmetic mode, 111 performs addition, 110 performs subtraction, 101 performs increment, and 100 performs decrement. In logic mode, 111 performs AND, 110 performs OR, 101 performs XOR, and 100 performs NOT. The design is self-contained and comes with a Verilog testbench that verifies the ALUâ€™s functionality by simulating various operations. Waveform generation is enabled using VCD dumping, which can be viewed in tools such as GTKWave or EPWave. Test cases include scenarios like 0xFF + 0x01 = 0x00 with carry set, 0xCC | 0x33 = 0xFF, ~0xAA = 0x55, and 0x00 - 0x01 = 0xFF with borrow set, ensuring correct operation of the ALU. The project folder contains the main design file (alu8_custom.v), the testbench file (tb_alu8_custom.v), the generated waveform file (alu8_custom.vcd), and this documentation. This ALU can serve as a fundamental building block for processors, digital systems, and educational purposes in Verilog design and simulation.
